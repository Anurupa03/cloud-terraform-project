# Terraform Infrastructure as Code Project

This project demonstrates Infrastructure as Code (IaC) practices using Terraform to manage two different environments:

- Docker-based infrastructure 
- Kubernetes cluster

Both projects showcase core Terraform concepts including modules, variables, outputs, state management, and resource dependencies.
